        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Each bite of this rich curry is packed with a world of flavors and textures from the chicken, bamboo shoots, baby corn, bell peppers, and Thai basil.</p>
        <p>"The vegetables aren't completely traditional, but they give the whole thing a good texture and variety," says recipe creator Galen Dobbs.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup Thai green curry paste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (1/4 inch thick) slice ginger, finely grated</li>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can baby corn pieces, drained</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained</li>
            <li>2 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons palm sugar</li>
            <li>6 makrut lime leaves</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 orange bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>¼ cup thinly sliced Thai basil, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic, and ginger; stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. Cook until just slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small saucepan, cover with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil. Drain then cover with water again.</li>
            <li>Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo shoots and add in. Stir in fish sauce, palm sugar, and lime leaves. Bring back up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in bell pepper strips and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove curry from heat and stir in Thai basil.</li>
        </ol>
